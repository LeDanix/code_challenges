# Code Challenges
This repository contains diferent code challenges.

## Game of Life - Python based
This project simulates cells behaviour into a NxN matrix.

The logic about the creation and elimination of the cells follows the next logic:

If a cell is sourronding by less than 2 cells or more than 3 cells, this cell dies. If not, remains.

If a empty space whitout any cell is sourronding by exactly 3 cells, a new one borns. If not, the empty space will remain.

This project is powered by Python, NumPy and MatplotLib for matrix visualization.

## Game of Life - Java based
This projects copy the same methodology as [the python based](#game-of-life---python-based).

Is powered by Java JDK 20 and only use java default libraries.
